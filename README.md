# Consolidation Challenge

I'm aware we need to put some personal file here we created and put that file here. I don't like writing about myself or sharing it publicly so I created my presentation in markdown and it's already on GitHub so I'll just link that here instead: [tech talk slides md-file](https://github.com/glgoose/tech-talk-1/blob/master/slides.md)

I'm making the assumption that the intention of the challenge is just to show you can do these operations and that the content is irrelevant.
