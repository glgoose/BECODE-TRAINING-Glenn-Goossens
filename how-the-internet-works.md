# How the interent works

When you type a URL in the browser, you are typing in a reference to a server location that has that webpage. The URL get's looked up in a DNS record to see what the IP address is of the server.

Using the TCP/IP protocol data get's send as packets to the server over the internet via wire or over the air. The server will respond with a html document. From that html document possible additional resources like css and javascript files may be fetched.
